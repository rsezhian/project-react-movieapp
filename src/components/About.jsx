          Before getting into the details of specific movie websites and
          discussing current trends, it’s important first to consider the
          primary purpose of movie websites. Obviously, in order for a movie to
          be financially successful, it needs to do well at the box office, and
          today many moviegoers use the Internet to find movies to see and to
          buy tickets. Having things like trailers and other video clips helps
          to engage visitors and encourages them to find show times and buy
          tickets online.
